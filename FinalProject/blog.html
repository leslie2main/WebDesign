            <h3>Top 5 Softball Drills for Beginners</h3>
            <p>These drills help players build confidence and develop solid fundamentals.
                1. Throw & Catch Basics:
This one seems simple, but it’s super important. Pair players up and start close together, focusing on stepping toward the target and using proper throwing form. As they get more comfortable, you can slowly move them farther apart. It’s a great way to build confidence and consistency early on.
2. Tee Hitting:
Tee work is perfect for beginners because it lets them focus on their swing without worrying about a moving ball. Have players work on their stance, grip, and making solid contact. Even just a few minutes on the tee can make a big difference.
3. Ground Ball Fielding:
Rolling ground balls to players helps them practice getting low, keeping their glove on the ground, and using two hands. This drill teaches good habits early and makes fielding feel way less intimidating.
4. Soft Toss Hitting:
Soft toss is a nice step up from tee work. Gently toss the ball from the side and let hitters focus on timing and control. It’s low-pressure and helps players start feeling more comfortable hitting live balls.
5. Base Running Basics:
Base running often gets overlooked, but it’s really important. Practice running through first base, rounding the bases, and understanding when to stop or keep going. This drill helps players feel more confident during real games.

            <h3>How to Improve Your Batting Stance</h3>
            <p>A few small adjustments can make a big difference in your power and accuracy.
                Improving your batting stance starts with getting comfortable and balanced in the box. Keep your feet about shoulder width apart, bend your knees slightly, and make sure your weight is evenly distributed. Your hands should stay relaxed near your back shoulder, and your eyes should stay focused on the pitcher. A strong stance should feel natural and controlled, not stiff, and even small adjustments can make a big difference in confidence and consistency at the plate.
