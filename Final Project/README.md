1. What’s something new you learned while building your site?
This website is a simple, fun place for softball players and coaches to find drills, tips, and practice ideas. I wanted it to be really easy to navigate so visitors can quickly see featured drills, read blog posts, and check practice schedules without getting lost. I tried to make the layout clean and organized, using headings, images, and sections that make sense. I also experimented with Flexbox and Grid to organize content in a way that looks good on both big screens and phones. Using Bootstrap for the navigation and responsive parts helped speed things up, and then I added my own CSS to make the design feel a little more personal, like the spacing, card layouts, and hover effects.
2. What are you most proud of in your final project?
I’m really proud of how everything came together visually and functionally. Getting the spacing and alignment right took some trial and error, but now the site feels balanced and readable. I also learned a lot about combining different tools like Bootstrap, Flexbox, and Grid in the same project. If I had more time, I’d probably add more interactive features, like a slideshow for drills or a scroll-to-top button. Overall, building this site taught me how to balance creativity with usability while keeping everything responsive and professional-looking.
