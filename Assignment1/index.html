    <!-- 📝 New Chapters Added Below -->

    <h3>Chapter 2: The Journey Begins</h3>
    <p>
        This chapter marks the true start of the adventure. The main character leaves 
        their familiar world and steps into something unknown, which is one of my favorite 
        moments because it sets the tone for what's coming.
    </p>

    <h3>Chapter 3: Into the Forest</h3>
    <p>
        The forest is full of mystery and atmosphere. I enjoy this part because it 
        introduces new environments, strange sounds, and the first hints that something 
        magical is happening.
    </p>

    <h3>Chapter 4: The Hidden Village</h3>
    <p>
        Discovering the hidden village changes everything for the characters. 
        This chapter is exciting because secrets are revealed, allies appear, 
        and the story takes a major turn.
