    <h1>Ideas for My Next Softball Website</h1>

    <p>
        For my next website, I’m thinking about creating something centered around softball, where I can showcase tips, drills, 
        and maybe highlight some favorite teams or players! I want to mix images and text to give a real feel for the sport 
        while practicing layouts, visuals, and simple interactions.

    <p>
        One tip I learned for Flexbox is to focus on one direction at a time — row or column — 
        and then adjust spacing and alignment inside that direction.
        For Grid, setting up grid-template-columns first helps create a clear structure, 
        then gap, justify-content, and align-items keep everything clean and predictable.
