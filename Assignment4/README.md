I really liked learning Flexbox and Grid because both of them made layout work feel a lot easier and more organized! Flexbox helped me line things up in a clean, predictable way, and Grid made it simple to build structured sections without fighting with margins or floating elements. I can already tell these tools will make future projects faster since I won’t have to struggle as much with spacing and alignment. Right now, I think I prefer Flexbox because it feels more intuitive, but Grid is growing on me as I get used to it!
